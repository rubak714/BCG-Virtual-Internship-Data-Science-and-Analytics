# Key roles and responsibilities of a Data Scientist at BCG GAMMA
BCG GAMMA is transforming businesses using data science to help companies generate competitive advantage. To do this, we typically follow a 5-step methodology:
- Business understanding & problem framing: what is the context of this problem and why are they trying to solve it?
- Exploratory data analysis & data cleaning: what data are we working with, what does it look like and how can we make it better?
- Feature engineering: can we enrich this dataset using our own expertise or third party information?
- Modeling and evaluation: Can we use this dataset to accurately make predictions? If so, are they reliable?
- Insights & Recommendations: how we can communicate the value of these predictions by explaining them in a way that matters to the business
The tasks in this program will be focused on using different parts of this methodology at different times, so youâ€™ll get a taste of the overall process.
