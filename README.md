# During this virtual Internship,

- I have worked as a Junior Data Scientist at BCG GAMMA.
- My work within a larger team, where each member has a different role and level of responsibility.
- My team has been assigned a new project for a client called PowerCo
- As a Junior Data Scientist, this is an opportunity to get valuable hands-on experience.I have worked on programming, problem solving and communication skills - all essential skills for life on the job as a data scientist!

# Key roles and responsibilities of a Data Scientist at BCG GAMMA
BCG GAMMA is transforming businesses using data science to help companies generate competitive advantage. To do this, we typically follow a 5-step methodology:
- Business understanding & problem framing: what is the context of this problem and why are they trying to solve it?
- Exploratory data analysis & data cleaning: what data are we working with, what does it look like and how can we make it better?
- Feature engineering: can we enrich this dataset using our own expertise or third party information?
- Modeling and evaluation: Can we use this dataset to accurately make predictions? If so, are they reliable?
- Insights & Recommendations: how we can communicate the value of these predictions by explaining them in a way that matters to the business
The tasks in this program will be focused on using different parts of this methodology at different times, so you’ll get a taste of the overall process.

# The brief from PowerCo
The Associate Director (AD) of the Data Science team held a team meeting to discuss the client brief. You’ll be working closely with Estelle Altazin, a senior data scientist on your team.

Here are the key takeaways from the meeting:

- Your client is PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises.
- The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.
- PowerCo are concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers. When a customer leaves to use another service provider, this is called churn.
- This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and they have engaged BCG to help diagnose the reason why their customers are churning.

During the meeting your AD discussed some potential reasons for this churn, one being how “sensitive” the price is. In other words, how much is price a factor in a customer’s choice to stay with or leave PowerCo?

# Email to AD
Dear Concern,

Following our team meeting, Estelle and I have outlined the approach to tackle PowerCo’s customer churn issue using the 5-step data science methodology. Here is our detailed plan:

Step 1: Business Understanding & Problem Framing

Problem Formulation: PowerCo is experiencing high customer churn rates. Our goal is to identify the factors contributing to customer churn, with a focus on price sensitivity, and provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning

Key Data Requirements:

Customer Data:

Customer demographics (age, gender, income level, etc.)
Business type and size
Location (geographical data)

Transactional Data:

Historical consumption patterns (monthly usage data)
Billing and payment history
Contract details (start date, end date, contract type)

Churn Data:

Historical churn data (which customers churned and when)
Reasons for churn (if available)

Competitive Data:

Market pricing data from competitors
Promotional offers and discounts from competitors

Customer Interaction Data:

Customer service interactions (number of complaints, resolution times, satisfaction ratings)
Customer feedback and survey data

Step 3: Feature Engineering

Potential Features to Engineer:

Price Sensitivity:

Price changes over time and corresponding changes in usage or churn rates
Price difference between PowerCo and competitors for similar usage levels

Customer Engagement:

Frequency and type of customer service interactions
Customer satisfaction scores from surveys

Contractual Factors:

Duration of customer contracts
Frequency of contract renewals

Usage Patterns:

Monthly/seasonal usage trends
Peak usage times and any penalties incurred

Step 4: Modeling and Evaluation

Techniques for Investigation:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to identify trends and anomalies
Correlation analysis to find relationships between features and churn

Predictive Modeling:

Classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict the likelihood of churn
Time-series analysis to detect changes in consumption patterns over time

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification models
ROC-AUC for model performance evaluation

Step 5: Insights & Recommendations

Visualization and Reporting:

Impact Analysis:

Heatmaps and correlation matrices to visualize relationships between price changes and churn
Survival analysis to understand customer tenure and its correlation with churn

Customer Segmentation:

Cluster analysis to segment customers based on their characteristics and behaviors
Targeted recommendations for each segment to reduce churn

Reporting:

Dashboards summarizing key findings and actionable insights
Detailed reports with visualizations to communicate the value of the predictions and recommendations

Key Reasons for Customer Churn:

Based on preliminary discussions, we believe the following factors could influence a customer’s decision to stay with or switch energy providers:

Price of energy services
Availability of clean energy options
Quality of customer service
Contract flexibility and terms
Geographic location and associated energy regulations

Data Analysis and Visualization:

Price Sensitivity Analysis: Visualize price changes and churn rates using line graphs and bar charts.
Customer Segmentation: Use clustering algorithms to group customers and visualize these segments with scatter plots or cluster maps.
Predictive Modeling: Build and validate predictive models to identify key predictors of churn. Visualize model performance using ROC curves and confusion matrices.

We look forward to your feedback and further instructions on this plan.

Best regards, 

Rubaiya & Estelle Altazin
